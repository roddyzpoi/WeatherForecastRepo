# Weather Forecast standalone web page populated using data from a weather forecasting API

# Utilises knockout js to handle dynamic display of data on the screen.  

# To do:
# Complete CSS styling (including adding weather icons).  Move styles into a site.css page and apply stylings via class attribute in tags.
# Implement QUnit unit testing, should nhave been done earlier but tried to get data flow to UI via knockout JS constructs first - this will require reformatting of the view model functions to make them more testable.
# Replave javascript date time with moment.js date time handling
# Review View model functionality especially around conversion of 3 hour into daily handling - there is a bug at present with the predominate daily weather.
# Connect the header band to the page knockout functionaility to allow menu items to trigger test and live behaviour.
# Complete City selector panel on the left hand side of the screen so that screen updates when different cities are selected.
# Add footer with trademark etc.

# Estimated time to completion to a commercial offering standard around 8 to 10 hours.


# To run:
# The page does not need a web server to function.  
# Simply copy the contents of the repository folder to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser.
# It has been tested on Chrome and Edge browsers.
